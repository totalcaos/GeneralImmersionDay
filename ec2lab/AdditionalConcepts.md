# **EC2 Hands On Lab (contd.)**
## **Changing the Instance Type**



Did you know that you can change the instance size and/or family of an EC2 instance at any time? 

This is very useful when you need a larger (or smaller) or perhaps different type of instance to run a workload. This only works with EC2 instances that use EBS (Elastic Block Store) or EBS backed instances (which is what weâ€™re running here).  

There is no particular reason to change the instance type in this lab, but the following steps outline how easy it is to do in AWS

In the AWS Console, select your EC2 instance, then right-click on it and hover over **Instance State** and select **Stop** (NOT Terminate).  Then select **Yes, Stop** to confirm.

After it has stopped, right-click on it again, hover over **Instance Settings** and select **Change Instance Type**

After going through the options and selecting **t3.large** as the instance type, right-click your lab instance and select **Start**

**_What happens to the public IP address after you start the instance again?_**

<Summary><b>Optional (Challenge Task) - Deploy an EC2 Instance Using CloudFormation</b></Summary>
<br>
The challenge here is to deploy an EC2 instance into the VPC we created earlier using code rather than through the console.  In order to do this you will:
<br>

* Create a t3.medium Windows EC2 Instance
* Tag it with the name "[Your Name] Web Server"
* Deploy it into the Public Subnet of the VPC we created earlier in this module
* Assign the Security Group _([Your Name] Web Server SG)_ we created earlier to the EC2 Instance
* Allocate an ElasticIP address to the EC2 Instance
* Test if we can browse to the website on the EC2 Instance

Use this CloudFormation Template as a starting point:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Resources:
  Ec2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ...

            Import-Module ServerManager;
            Install-WindowsFeature Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools -IncludeAllSubFeature
            remove-item -recurse c:\inetpub\wwwroot\*
            (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://immersionday-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-windows.zip", "c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ec2-windows.zip")

            $shell = new-object -com shell.application
            $zip = $shell.NameSpace("c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ec2-windows.zip")
            foreach($item in $zip.items())
            {
              $shell.Namespace("c:\inetpub\wwwroot\").copyhere($item)
            }
            Start-Process "iisreset.exe" -NoNewWindow -Wait

            Import-Module NetSecurity;
            Set-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)" -enabled True
            </powershell>
      ...
      ...
  EIpAddress:

    Value: !Ref 'EIpAddress'

<Summary><b>Optional (Challenge Task) - Modify Instance size using the AWS CLI</b></Summary>

To complete this task you will need to:
* First, stop the instance using the AWS CLI
* Use the *"modify-instance-attribute"* command to change the size of the instance

```bash
bash-3.2$ aws ec2 stop-instances .....
bash-3.2$ aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute ....
```

<Summary><b>Optional Task - Deploy an <i><u>Amazon Linux</u></i> EC2 Instance</b></Summary>
<br>
Modify the CloudFormation Template you created above to deploy an Amazon Linux EC2 Instance.  Use the code below in the user data section to deploy a webserver on the instance.

```bash
#include
https://s3.amazonaws.com/immersionday-labs/bootstrap.sh
```
